# Github Repo Search

## Description
Github Repo Search is nice and simple tool that does what it says on the tin. It queries the Github Search API and shows the top 30 results for public Github repositories.

## </a>Gems used
- httparty (For easily making API calls)
- sass-rails (Probably didnt need this but I like nesting CSS where applicable)
